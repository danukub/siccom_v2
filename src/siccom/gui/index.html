<p>The program allows the simulation of spatial dynamics in a benthic coral reef community under various environmental settings in monthly iterations.  
	Several coral species, with either massive or branching colony growth morphologies are implemented as individual colonies, which  
	compete for space with each other as well as with macroalgae and algal turf.</p> 
	
<p>Coral species can be parametrised with respect to different life history characteristics, such as growth, reproduction, competitive abilities 
	and susceptibilities to environmental conditions, such as extreme temperature events.
	
<p>Life history characteristics of macroalgae, such as reproduction, growth, maximum size and mortality can likewise be parametrised. Algal turf is 
	parametrised in a more simple fashion. 
<p>Algae are controlled by grazing. Within each time step each alga will be eaten with a certain probablility which is dependent on the 
	overall algal density and calculated as follows:
